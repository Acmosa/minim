    "\n",
    "The `minim.qobuz` submodule offers procedural and object-oriented approaches to use the Qobuz API:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `minim.qobuz.Session` class, which is targeted at developers and experienced programmers, implements the Qobuz API exactly on top of the `requests` library. There are no bells and whistles; responses from API calls, if any, are in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, and data extraction from or wrangling of the JSON data is done solely by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `minim.qobuz.Album`, `minim.qobuz.Artist`, `minim.qobuz.Label`, `minim.qobuz.Playlist`, `minim.qobuz.Track`, and `minim.qobuz.User` classes are more user-friendly and are meant for beginners or hobbyists. Instead of having the user make API calls directly and deal with unpacking the JSON responses, these classes do all the heavy lifting and store the information returned by the API in instance attributes that have simple, logical names and are well-documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of which approach above you choose, it is recommended that you have a Qobuz account and, preferably, a Qobuz streaming plan to get access to all the API endpoints.\n",
